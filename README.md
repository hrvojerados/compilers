# compilers
This repository is used to store my work for the course "Programming Language Translation" or in Croatian "PrevoÄ‘enje programskih jezika"

# Problem description and constraints

Problem description is in properly named pdf (which is unfortunately in croatian but I'll see if I can find a translated version latter)

# There are 4 laboratory exercises but only 2 are uploaded

This is because I'm still waiting for third one to be graded (I don't want to fail on plag scans because I uploaded it online) and fourth one I haven't done yet. Also second one is incomplete.
