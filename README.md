# compilers
This repository is used to store my work for the course "Programming Language Translation" or in Croatian "PrevoÄ‘enje programskih jezika"

# Problem description and constraints

Problem description is in properly named pdf (which is unfortunately in croatian but I'll see if I can find a translated version latter)

# There are 4 laboratory exercises but only 3 are uploaded

This is because I haven't done the fourth one yet. Also second one is incomplete.

# Full story behind this project
As a CS student I enrolled into a course about compilers. My college (FER-Zagreb) along with standard lectures and exams about this subject also 
has "laboratory exercises" or as we students like to call them "labs" or in Croatian "labosi". Labs can vary from subject to subject.
They can be just small exams, some short exercises or in this case whole projects. Here I had a choice, I could on my own do the easier version
but get less points or to do a harder version with someone else (group work). I decided for the latter, but my friend and I through some discussiondecided to do this on our own as a challenge. As you can see I didn't manage to finish this (I think I did about 65% of the work) and he didn't do much better. It's a very demanding exercise and It was hard to balance it with other work but it taught me how to work on bigger projects and I hope that one day I will revisit it but trying it in Haskell (this sounded better in my head tbf).
